DM stage takes a full cycle, hence stalling is done till the DM stage is complete incase of DataHazards
i have made two objects in 7-9 pipeline for writeback stage as it might be possible that we are using WB in this stage for both one in 7 and one in 9

the registers cannot be used by both names and instead need to be referred to by only one name for the forwarding/dataHazards logic to work properly
